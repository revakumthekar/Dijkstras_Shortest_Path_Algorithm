<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>

CS400Graph.java - This file is where the functionality of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is implemented. This class creates a graph off of a set of 
  vertices (stored in Hashtable) and edges, and uses this data in methods that interact with the graph while getting information from it.
GraphADT.java - This is an interface that holds all of the methods that need to be instantiated for a Graph.
GraphTest.java - Tests the CS400Graph.java class to see if all of the methods work as they should and mainly if Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is properly
  implemented
